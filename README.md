These are a few Lua scripts I wrote for [Weechat][1]. If you want to use any
script in this repo, put the lua file in your `~/.weechat/lua` directory and then
inside WeeChat run the following command:

    /lua load lua/name-of-script.lua

Scripts that are already in [official WeeChat scripts repo][2] can be installed
using:

    /script install name-of-script.lua
