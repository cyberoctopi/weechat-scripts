# empty_complete

This script will allow you to press Tab on empty input line and make it complete
to the recently active nicks in a channel. It's similar to [zerotab.py][] except
with this script you're not limited to just one nick. If you keep keep pressing
tab it will keep completing to the next nick who is recently active.
